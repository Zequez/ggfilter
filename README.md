# GGFilter

[GGFilter](http://www.ggfilter.com/) is not open source *just yet*. I'm still figuring out the direction of the project. And I want to clean up the codebase before open sourcing it ðŸ˜…. For now I created this repository for bug tracking and features suggestions.

The current GGFilter app is actully made out of 3 separate projects:

- The scrapers (made in Ruby, and I have a prototype in JavaScript/node)
- The back-end undocumented API (made with Rails)
- The front-end (made with React)
